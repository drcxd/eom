#+title: Exercise 0.4.4

"the number of possible sums" means that the same sum coming from
different elements count as one? For example, \(1 + 4\) and \(2 + 3\).

We can solve this problem by first determine the possible number of
combinations of choosing \(m\) elements from \(n\) elements, then
minus the number of duplicate sums from it.

I can not figure out how to compute the number of duplicated
sums. Thus, this way does not work.

Another way to solve the problem is to notice that all sums are
consecutive natural numbers in a certain range when working on some
specific cases of the problem.

The smallest sum is the sum of the \(m\) smallest elements of \(\{1,
2, ..., n\}\), while the greatest sum is the sum of the \(m\) greatest
elements. By carefully select the elements of the \(m\)-element
subset, we can make its sum be an arbitrary number in the range. For
example, assume we start with the \(m\) greatest elements, we can
always make the sum smaller by one by replacing one element of the
subset by another one that is one smaller than the element and outside
the subset. This can be done until the \(m\) elements are the \(m\)
smallest elements of \(\{1, 2, ..., n\}\).

Thus, the number of possible sums is

\[\begin{align*}
S_{\text{max}} - S_{\text{min}} + 1 &= n + (n - 1) + ... + (n - (m - 1)) + 1 + ... + m + 1 \\
&= m(n+1) + 1
\end{align*}\]
