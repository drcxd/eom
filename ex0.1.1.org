#+title: Exercise 0.1.1

Since $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is a set of sets, as long as A is not a set of
sets, it is obvious that $A$ is not a subset of $\mathcal{P}(A)$.

For example, let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then \(\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\emptyset,
\{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}\}\). Obviously, \(A \not \subset \mathcal{P}(A)\).
