#+title: Exercise 0.3.1

First, we prove if there exists an injective map \(f : A \rightarrow B\), then
there exists a surjective map \(g : B \rightarrow A\):

Since \(f\) is injective we have \(a \neq a' \Rightarrow f(a) \neq f(a'), a, a' \in A\),
thus, we can define \(g\) as \(g : f(X) \rightarrow A\), \(g(b) = a\) such that
\(f(a) = g(b)\). \(g\) is surjective since for any unique \(a \in A\)
there exists a unique \(f(a) \in B\), for \(f\) is injective.

Then, we prove if there exists a surjective map \(g : B \rightarrow A\), then
there exists an injective map \(f : A \rightarrow B\):

Since \(g\) is surjective, we can partition \(B\) into a collection of
non-empty sets \(\{B_a | a \in A\} \) such that for any \(b \in B_a\), and
some \(a \in A\), \(g(b) = a\). Because of the axiom of choice, there
exists a set \(B' = \{b_a | a \in A\}\) such that \(b_a \in B_a\).  We define
\(f : A \rightarrow B'\) as \(f(a) = b\) such that \(g(b) = f(a)\). \(f\) is
injective since there is only one element \(b\) in \(B'\) such that
\(g(b) = f(a)\). \(f\) is also a injective map on \(A \rightarrow B\) since \(B'
\subset B\).
