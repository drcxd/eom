#+title: Exercise 0.3.2

If an equivalent relation \(R\) on \(A\) is functional, the it must
satisfy the vertical intersection property, that is \(R \cap \{a\} \times A\),
for some \(a \in A\) exactly once. That is, for some \(a \in A\), there is
only one element \(a' \in A\) such that \(aRa'\). Since \(R\) is an
equivalent relation, it is relfexive, thus we have for any \(a \in A\),
itself is the only element that satisfy the relation \(aRa\). This
means that \(R = \mathbf{1}_A\).
