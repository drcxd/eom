#+title: Exercise 0.4.1

To prove \(A\) is uncountable, we can prove \(|A|
= |\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})|\). This can be done by finding a bijection
\(f : A \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\).

A sequence \(s \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \rightarrow \{0, 1\}\) can be mapped
to an element of \(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\) in such a way that if the
\(i\)-th number in the sequence is 1, then the number \(i\) is an
element of the mapped set. Obviously, this is a bijection. By Cantor
Theorem, we have \(|A| = |\mathcal{P}(N)| > |\mathbb{N}|\).
